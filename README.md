# Shamir-s-Secret-Sharing-Python-code
Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm is Key securing algorithm in which the key is split into N parts(called Shares) and the original key is reconstructed from any k shares out of N.
Here I implemeted a python code for N=4 shares out of which minimun k=2 shares are required for reconstruction.
